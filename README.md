# SQL-Sales-Analysis-project
"SQL project for analyzing sales data: segmentation, revenue trends, and insights using SQL Server."


## Project Overview  
This project demonstrates how SQL can be used for **data analysis and business insights**.  
I used **SQL Server** to analyze a sales dataset and performed **customer segmentation, revenue analysis, and trend exploration** using advanced SQL queries such as window functions and joins.  

The goal of this project is to showcase my ability to:  
- Write efficient SQL queries  
- Work with relational databases  
- Perform real-world business analysis using SQL  

## Key Analysis Performed  
- **Customer Segmentation** → Grouped customers by region, gender, and age group.  
- **Revenue Trends** → Calculated daily and monthly revenue.  
- **Running Total (Cumulative Revenue)** → Applied window functions for trend analysis.  
- **Top Customers & Products** → Identified high-value customers and best-selling products.  
- **Joins Across Tables** → Combined Customers, Sales, and Products tables for deeper insights.  

## Technologies Used  
- **SQL Server** – Database & query execution  
- **SQL Window Functions** – Running totals, ranking  
- **Aggregate Functions** – SUM, COUNT, AVG, GROUP BY  
- **SQL Joins** – INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN  



## Insights Gained  
- Certain regions contributed the most revenue.  
- Younger customers showed higher purchase frequency.  
- Top 10% of customers contributed to ~80% of revenue (**Pareto principle**).  
- Running totals showed consistent revenue growth over time.  


## How to Run the Project  
1. Download the dataset.  
2. Import data into **SQL Server**.  
3. Run the queries inside `sales_analysis.sql`.  
4. Check the insights and results in `Project_Report.pdf`.
